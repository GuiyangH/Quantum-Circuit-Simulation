# Quantum Circuit Simulation
## Introduction
Simulate the dynamics of a quantum circuit given its Hamiltonian. 
## Files:
variables.mat: The common terms(matrices) that are used within the simulation.

pulse_shape_slow.m: The wave bracket of an applied pulse, which consists a rising part, a falling part and a persisting part.

single_qubit.m: The simulation of one shot single qubit operation (gate).

Circuit_Simulation.m: The simulation of a quantum circuit with control pulses.

multirun.m: Use this file to run 'Circuit_Simulation.m' repetatively to find optimal control sequences.
